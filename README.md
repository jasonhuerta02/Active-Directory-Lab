# Active Directory and SIEM Lab

## Objective

The Active Directory and SIEM Lab was designed to simulate a domain environment to monitor real-world attack scenarios and generate telemetry for security analysis. The project involved configuring Active Directory to manage user accounts, using Kali Linux for conducting brute-force attacks, integrating Splunk for centralized log ingestion and threat detection, and employing Atomic Red Team to emulate threats. 

### Skills Learned

- Configured Active Directory for user account provisioning
- Conducted brute-force attacks using Kali Linux to simulate an attack
- Configured Splunk to ingest and analyze security logs
- Utilized Atomic Red Team tests to emulate MITRE ATT&CK techniques
- Deep understanding of log sources and event types for threat detection
